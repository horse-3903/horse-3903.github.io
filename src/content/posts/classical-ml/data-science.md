# Syllabus Map

* Study map: [Syllabus Study Map](/posts/syllabus/ioai-study-map/)

---
# Overview

* Data science fundamentals cover evaluation, validation, and feature workflows.
* Emphasis is on reliable model assessment and clean data pipelines.

---

# Evaluation Metrics

## Classification Metrics

* Accuracy.
* Precision.
* Recall.
* F1-score.

## Diagnostic Tools

* Confusion matrix.
* ROC curve and AUC.

---

# Bias, Variance, and Generalization

## Underfitting

* Model is too simple to capture signal.

## Overfitting

* Model memorizes noise and fails to generalize.

---

# Validation Strategy

## Train / Validation / Test Split

* Use separate splits to avoid leakage.

## Cross-Validation

* Estimate generalization more robustly.

---

# Feature Engineering

## Encoding

* One-hot encoding.
* Target or frequency encoding.

## Statistical Features

* Mean, variance, percentiles.
* Rolling windows for time series.

## Embeddings

* Learned dense representations for text, images, and audio.

---

# Data Processing

## Missing Values

* Impute with mean/median or model-based methods.

## Scaling

* Standardization or normalization.

## Data Augmentation

* Flip, crop, noise injection.
