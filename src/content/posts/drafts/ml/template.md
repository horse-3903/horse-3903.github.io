# Overview

<Give a short, high-level introduction to the topic — what it is and why it matters.>

---

# Mathematical Formulation

<Define the key equations or the main function (e.g., hypothesis function).>

$$
<Equation(s)>
$$

---

# Cost / Loss Function

<Explain what the loss measures and why it’s used.>

$$
<Cost Function Equation>
$$

---

# Gradient Descent / Optimization
