# Overview

* Deep learning uses multiple layers to learn hierarchical features.
* Representations can be learned from text, images, and audio.

---

# Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)

## Core Idea

* Stack fully connected layers.
* Learn nonlinear decision boundaries.

## Practical Notes

* Requires careful initialization and regularization.
* Often paired with batch normalization and dropout.

---

# Data Embeddings

## Text

* Word or sentence embeddings.

## Image

* CNN feature vectors.

## Audio

* Spectrogram-based embeddings.

---

# Pooling Techniques

## Max Pooling

* Keeps strongest activation in a region.

## Average Pooling

* Smooths activations by averaging.
