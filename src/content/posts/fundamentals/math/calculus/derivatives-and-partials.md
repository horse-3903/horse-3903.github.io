# Core Idea

* Derivative measures rate of change.
* Partial derivative changes one variable at a time in multivariate functions.

## Key Formulas

$$
\frac{d}{dx}x^n = nx^{n-1}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}
$$

## Practical Notes

### Derivative sign indicates direction of change.

* Positive increases, negative decreases locally.

### Magnitude indicates sensitivity.

* Larger absolute values mean stronger local effect.

## Why This Matters for ML

* Loss optimization depends on parameter-wise sensitivity.
