# Core Idea

* Critical points satisfy $\nabla f(x)=0$.
* They can be minima, maxima, or saddle points.

## Practical Notes

### Saddle points are common in high dimensions.

* Training can stall even without being at a useful minimum.

### Curvature diagnostics help interpretation.

* Hessian sign patterns indicate local geometry.

## Why This Matters for ML

* Important for understanding non-convex neural network optimization.
