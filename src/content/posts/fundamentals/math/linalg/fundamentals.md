# Required Concepts

## Vectors, Norms, and Dot Product

* Vector representation of features and parameters
* Norms ($L_1$, $L_2$) as magnitude/penalty measures
* Dot product for similarity and projections

## Matrices and Matrix Multiplication

* Matrix shapes and compatibility rules
* Matrix multiplication as linear transformation
* Transpose and basic matrix identities

## Determinant and Invertibility

* Determinant as volume scaling
* Singular vs invertible matrices
* Why non-invertibility causes instability

## Linear Systems and Rank

* Solving $Ax=b$
* REF/RREF intuition and pivots
* Rank and linear independence

## Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, and Spectral View

* Direction-preserving transformations
* Eigendecomposition intuition
* Connection to covariance and PCA

## Projections and Orthogonality

* Orthogonal vectors and subspaces
* Projection geometry in least squares

## Covariance and Quadratic Forms

* Covariance matrix interpretation
* Quadratic forms in optimization and distance

## SVD/PCA Intuition

* Singular values and principal directions
* Dimensionality reduction and low-rank structure

## Why This Matters for ML

* These concepts are foundational for representing data, transformations, and optimization structures in ML.
* They are repeatedly used in core IOAI syllabus algorithms and analyses.
