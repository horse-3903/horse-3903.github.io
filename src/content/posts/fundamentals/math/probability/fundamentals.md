# Required Concepts

## Random Variables, Expectation, and Variance

* Distribution of outcomes
* Mean as central tendency
* Variance as spread/uncertainty

## Conditional Probability and Bayes Rule

* Updating beliefs with evidence
* Posterior reasoning

## Common Distributions

* Bernoulli/Binomial for binary/count outcomes
* Gaussian for continuous noise and aggregate effects

## Likelihood and MLE

* Parameter fitting by maximizing observed-data likelihood
* Log-likelihood and numerical optimization

## Entropy, Cross-Entropy, and KL Divergence

* Uncertainty and information mismatch measures
* Core losses for classification and representation learning

## Bias-Variance Tradeoff

* Decomposition of prediction error
* Underfitting vs overfitting behavior

## Sampling and Data Splits

* Train/validation/test protocol
* Data leakage awareness

## Correlation vs Independence

* Linear association vs full probabilistic independence
* Common interpretation pitfalls

## Basic Statistical Inference

* Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing intuition
* Interpreting model comparisons with uncertainty

# Why This Matters for ML

* ML models optimize expected loss under uncertain data.
* Evaluation, calibration, generalization, and uncertainty all depend on probability/statistics.
* Key methods in logistic regression, generative modeling, and dimensionality reduction are probabilistic.
