# Core Idea

* Bernoulli models binary outcomes.
* Binomial models count of successes.
* Gaussian models continuous noise and aggregate effects.

## Practical Notes

### Match distribution assumptions to data type.

* Wrong assumptions degrade calibration and fit quality.

## Why This Matters for ML

* Many losses and likelihoods are derived from these distributions.
