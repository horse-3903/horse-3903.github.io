# Core Idea

* Correlation captures linear association.
* Independence means full probabilistic non-influence.

## Key Point

* Independence implies zero correlation (under finite variance), but not the reverse.

## Why This Matters for ML

* Critical for feature analysis, causal caution, and assumption checking.
