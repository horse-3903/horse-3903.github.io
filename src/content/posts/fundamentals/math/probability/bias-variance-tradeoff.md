# Core Idea

* Total error can be decomposed into bias, variance, and irreducible noise.

## Practical Notes

### High bias underfits; high variance overfits.

* Model complexity and regularization control this tradeoff.

## Why This Matters for ML

* Explains generalization behavior across model families.
