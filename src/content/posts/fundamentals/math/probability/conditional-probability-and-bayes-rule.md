# Core Idea

* Conditional probability updates beliefs given evidence.

## Key Formula

$$
P(A\mid B)=\frac{P(B\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

## Practical Notes

### Priors matter when data is limited.

* Posterior estimates can be prior-dominated in low-data settings.

## Why This Matters for ML

* Central for probabilistic modeling and classifier reasoning.
