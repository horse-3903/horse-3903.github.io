# Core Idea

* Hypothesis tests assess whether observed effects are likely under a null hypothesis.
* Confidence intervals quantify uncertainty in estimated quantities.

## Practical Notes

### Report uncertainty, not only point estimates.

* Include intervals or repeated-run variability in comparisons.

## Why This Matters for ML

* Confidence intervals and significance testing contextualize model comparison results.
* They help separate real performance gains from random variation.
* Ablation and benchmark claims are stronger when paired with uncertainty estimates.
* Inference basics improve rigor in experimental ML reporting.
