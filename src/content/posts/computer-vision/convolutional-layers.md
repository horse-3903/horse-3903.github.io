# Overview

* Convolutions extract local spatial patterns.
* Stacking layers builds hierarchical visual features.

---

# Convolution Basics

## Core Idea

* Apply a learnable filter across the image.
* Capture edges, textures, and shapes.

## Key Concepts

* Kernels and stride.
* Padding and output size.

# Pre-trained Vision Encoders

## Examples

* ResNet.
* Other CNN backbones (VGG, EfficientNet).

## Practical Notes

* Use for transfer learning.
* Freeze early layers when data is limited.
