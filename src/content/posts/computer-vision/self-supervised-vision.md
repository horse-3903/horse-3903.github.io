# Overview

* Self-supervised learning builds visual features without manual labels.

---

# Core Ideas

## Pretext Tasks

* Predict masked patches.
* Solve contrastive objectives.

## Representation Learning

* Learn embeddings that transfer to downstream tasks.

---

# Practical Notes

* Requires large, diverse datasets.
* Often used before supervised fine-tuning.
