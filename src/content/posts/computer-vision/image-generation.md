# Overview

* Generative models synthesize realistic images.

# Generating Images with GANs

## Core Idea

* Generator creates samples.
* Discriminator judges real vs fake.

## Practical Notes

* Training can be unstable.
* Requires careful balance of G and D.

# Diffusion Models

## Core Idea

* Learn to denoise from random noise to a data sample.

## Practical Notes

* Produces high-quality results.
* Often slower at inference.
