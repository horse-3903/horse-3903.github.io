# About Me

Hey there! I’m **Rafael**, a student and programmer passionate about applying technology to solve real-world problems — especially in **machine learning, cybersecurity, and innovation**.

## Coding & Technical Journey

I started coding when I was first introduced to simple scripts and quickly became fascinated by how lines of logic could automate, predict, and even _create_.  
Over the years, I’ve explored multiple domains, including:

- **Machine Learning & AI** — building prototypes like *LabAssist*, a vision-based AI system that detects procedural errors in chemistry labs, and *PhishHook*, a Chrome extension for scam detection.  
- **Cybersecurity** — experimenting with CTFs (Capture The Flag challenges), exploring topics like web exploits, forensics, and open source intelligence (OSINT).  
- **Web & App Development** — working with frameworks like Astro, React, and FastAPI to build practical tools and interactive interfaces.

These experiences have shaped how I view programming — not just as a technical skill, but as a creative medium.

## What I’m Working On

I’m currently diving deeper into:

- **AI for education** — designing tools that make digital literacy and learning more accessible for underprivileged communities.  
- **Open-source innovation** — contributing to and maintaining lightweight, efficient models for deployment on low-cost hardware.  
- **Entrepreneurship in tech** — exploring how small-scale AI systems can be productized to create social impact.

## Beyond the Code

Outside of programming, I’m always experimenting with **design**, **public speaking**, and **community outreach**.  
Whether it’s mentoring peers, leading school hackathon teams, or designing creative outreach campaigns, I love blending **technology with storytelling**.

## Looking Ahead

My long-term goal is to continue bridging the gap between **AI research and practical impact** — whether that means creating deployable tools for education, improving accessibility, or just making technology feel more _human_.
